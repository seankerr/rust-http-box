## What is http-box?

http-box is a push oriented HTTP 1 & 2 parser with the goal of remaining fast
and bare bones. Utilities are provided for handling additional HTTP details such
as query parsing, decoding hex encoded strings, and header field parsing.

The intent of http-box is to parse HTTP content and nothing more, so you will
not find `Request` or `Response` types within the library. They have not been
ruled out entirely, however, if they are provided at any future point, they will
be provided by a utility crate.

http-box will happily process any `&[u8]` data, and is not tied to any socket or
network dependencies.

## Features
